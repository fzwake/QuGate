<b>Controlled-Phase Gate Structure</b><br/>
This device simulation tool simulate a two-qubit controlled-phase gate based on a double-quantum-dot structure as shown below.
The basis for the control bit is (|0>, |1>), and the basis for the target bit is (|+>),|->)
The characteristics of the CZ gate is assessed when the controlled rotation angle is &pi.
The quantum gate operation is based on detuning two quantum dots, by applying a detunning gate voltage (voltage difference) between two gate electrode.

This input parameters to the quantum gate device simulation tool are the initial state,the magnetic field at quantum dot 1 and dot2, as B1 and B2) respectively, 
The Detuning gate voltage, <b> the interdot tunnel couplinng strength,the dephasing rate (1/T2), and the gate efficiency factor(0<&alpha<1)</b>, which describes how efficiently the gate electrodes modulate the quantum dot levels.
(For the exact definition of those parameters, please view Ref. [1] below)
